//                         Why Recursion Not Always Good

/*
Recursion is a good approach, when solving a problem

Programmer need to decide and impact of using recursive/Iterative approach while solving problem

In case of factorial calculation, Recursion save time of code

In case of Fibonacci calculation, Recursion doesn't save time as compared to iterative approach

because no. of calls increases in Recursion ,
