/*
C PREPROCESSOR - It is tool used to processing of c program before compilation process

Complier convert text form of program to executable
When we compile our program, there r 4 steps performed behind the scene

PreProcessing - Remove of comments , Expansion of Macros/include files 
Compilation   - Assembly level instructions generated
Assembly      - Which assembler understand , .o,.exe created , printf not resolved Ali converted to machine code
Linking       - It resolves fn calls , linker knows which fn where defined , so it combined all files and implementation , we get full program  (LINKS THE FN IMPLEMENATTION)

What is PreProcessor - It comes before compilation process, It is not part of compiler, It is text subsitution tool, all Preprocessor coomands stats with #      Ex- #include<stdio.h>
