//                                          File I/O in C

/*
Data vs Information - data is bits of storage , which we collected , when we process this data and make meaningful is called Info.

Why we need file

Files used to store data and info.
Files used to read / access data anytime from hard disk
File make it easy for programmer to access & store content without losing it on program

                Volatile Memory                                                 Non Volatile Memory
1.          it is storage while the device is on                            It is also storage while device is on/off
2.          It will hold data while device on                               It holds data forever and whenever you want
3.          it hold temporary data                                          It holds long term storage data
                  Ex- RAM                                                          EX- HARD DISK

Why Do We need files ?

When c program terminated, data stored in RAM is lost
storing data in file will preserve our data even after program terminates     
RAM not able to handle large amount of data while hard disk can handle
Easy to tranfer data in form of files

Types of files
TEXT FILES   - stores data in plain text, can be opened using text editor (Ex- Notepad)
BINARY FILES - Files r tricky and more secure, inside 01 data(Binary data)

File Operations - Creating new file, Opening a file , Closing a file, Reading from and writing a file
